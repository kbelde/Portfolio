SALES_FACT Table – The fact table containing transaction data such as event time, price, user ID, and product details.
USER_DIM Table – The dimension table storing customer-level attributes like segmentation, frequency, and lifetime value.
Cohort Month Column – The field representing the month and year of a customer’s first purchase, used for tracking retention trends.
